I don’t regret, I don’t call, I don’t cry,
Everything will pass like smoke from white apple trees.
Withered in gold, covered in gold,
I won't be young anymore.
Now you won't fight so much,******
A heart touched by a chill,******
And the country of birch chintz
It won't tempt you to wander around barefoot.
The wandering spirit! you are less and less
You stir up the flame of your lips
Oh my lost freshness,
A riot of eyes and a flood of feelings.
